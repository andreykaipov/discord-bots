Thank you so much for getting back to me cause this has really been bugging me the last few days and
normally if this was some person I just met, I would have really just moved on and forgot that they
existed; but Allan is like family to me so that’s why I’m just trying to figure out what’s going on.

My issue with Allan is that he’s become distant ever since 6-10 months ago. I’m definitely not one
to talk since I’m beyond busy all the time, but we still texted here and there or gamed out; but the
last few times we spoke, it was facilitated by me; whether I texted the group between him and I with
David or I texted him about the wedding or birthday. He did reach out to me on my birthday and we
texted about my grandparents but other than that, we never spoke.

So I texted him the other day to see how’s everyone is doing and I was sharing with Allan that I’m
really pissed and upset that he never invites me anymore to play or see each other or just a usual
“how are you” like he always did (something I always complimented him on). I mentioned to him that
he’s become distant and really left me hanging when he started playing with Andy and Co. and kinda
dropped me on the sideline. 

In the middle of this, he’s texting me like a robot and instead of understanding where I am coming
from, he was just saying “thanks for sharing” and ending the convo without addressing anything. Idk
about you, but when someone is just texting you like a stranger and visibly trying to end the
conversation, my blood boils… he even mentioned how people have different paths in life and I had no
idea what that had to do with what we were talking about.

Tbh, in the moment all I saw was red considering everything I’ve done for him and Vice versa and
instead of going to cursing and telling him off with how he’s texting me and acting, I wanted to
reach out to you or David and see if he’s maybe going through something or if I potentially did
something?
